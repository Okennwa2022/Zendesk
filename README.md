# Zendesk
Hands-on tutorials with Zendesk, where I simulated IT support tasks such as logging and prioritizing tickets, managing user requests, applying macros, and escalating unresolved issues. This experience helped me develop problem-solving, communication, and ticketing system management skills, which are essential in IT support and help desk roles.
